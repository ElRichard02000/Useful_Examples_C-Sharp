Extension methods enable you to "add" methods to existing types without creating a new derived type, recompiling, or otherwise modifying the original type. Extension methods are a special kind of static method(need static class), but they are called as if they were instance methods on the extended type. 

This method provides an opportunity to replace letters in latin text by corresponding armenian letters
