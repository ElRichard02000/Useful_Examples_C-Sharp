2. **Equals(Object, Object)** (static) Determines whether the specified object instances are considered equal.

3. **GetHashCode()** Serves as the default hash function.

4. **GetType()** Gets the Type of the current instance.

5. **MemberwiseClone()** (protected) Creates a shallow copy of the current Object.
 
6. **ReferenceEquals(Object, Object)** (static) Determines whether the specified Object instances are the same instance.

7. **ToString()** Returns a string that represents the current object.
